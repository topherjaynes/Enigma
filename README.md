I'm curious in how the Enigma machine works. I think it would be fun to try and implement the mechanics in Python to learn the process and a little about the math. This is a journey to code it up and understand early cryptography. Phase II would be building a way to "break" the code. Yes, this was inpired by watching 'Imitation Game'
